      "Hackers Rewards explained": "Hacker rewards are based on changing NFT collections, which are categorized by project vault and level of severity disclosure. NFT rewards will be changed as vulnerabilities are discovered, and as artist partnerships develop.Current NFT rewards can be found in the Hats Finance app by exploring vault severities. \n\n In order to obtain NFT rewards, hackers must disclose a vault vulnerability categorized from 1-4 (low to critical severity). Low severity usually represents a minor bug , while critical vulnerabilities usually refer to loss of funds and issues with basic functions. Once the vulnerability disclosure is accepted, hackers receive the bug bounty, as well as the NFT assigned to the vulnerability severity. This means that from a NFT rarity perspective, only the most talented and brilliant hackers will be able to access critical severity NFTs",

Our main goal is to incentivize hackers beyond monetary gain, by giving them a sense of pride in the ownership of a rare and valuable NFT that can only be obtained by successfully protecting the funds of a protocol or project. We see artists as an essential part of Hats growth, and we are excited to showcase the graphical and artistic concepts of Hats values through digital art.",
