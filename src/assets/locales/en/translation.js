  "NFT vision explained": "Hats Finance incentivizes hackers to do the right thing. We believe that ethical hacking will transform the future of DeFi, and having the right incentives in place will fix many of the smart contract vulnerabilities we have today. \n \n \n At Hats, we believe NFTs are disrupting the world, as they will become a key component in our societyâ€™s shift to digital presence, opening the doors to a tokenized world. While many investors get involved for monetary gain, NFTs also represent sole ownership, digital identity and community belonging. We believe that the future lies in NFTs, that is why we make it a key component in our project. \n \n \n Our goal is to incentivize hackers beyond monetary gain, by giving them a sense of pride in the ownership of a rare and valuable NFT that can only be obtained by successfully hacking a protocol and disclosing vulnerabilities to the development team. For every successful vulnerability submitted, the hacker has access to the designated Vault (ranging from 20% to 100% of the total vault). The low supply and high skill required to obtain a Hats NFT will drive market prices and build a community around crypto security. Hackers that can execute complex attacks will also receive a certified badge that displays their significant contribution to the crypto ecosystem. ",
  "Call for artists": "CALL FOR ARTISTS",
  "Call for artists explained": "The expected growth of Hats finance will soon require quality NFTs to be available for hackers and the Hats community. That is the reason why we are calling out artists and creatives that want to contribute to the bigger vision of crypto security and become key contributors to the biggest white hacks in DeFi. If you are an artist that wants to contribute to the growth of Hats Finance, feel free to apply for an exhibition slot and send your designs to be used as a valuable prize for hackers.",
