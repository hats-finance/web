NFT rewards will be changed as vulnerabilities are discovered, and as artist partnerships develop.Current NFT rewards can be found in the Hats Finance app by exploring vault severities. \n\n In order to obtain NFT rewards, hackers must disclose a vault vulnerability categorized from 1-4 (low to critical severity). Low severity usually represents a minor bug , while critical vulnerabilities usually refer to loss of funds and issues with basic functions. Once the vulnerability disclosure is accepted, hackers receive the bug bounty, as well as the NFT assigned to the vulnerability severity. This means that from a NFT rarity perspective, only the most talented and brilliant hackers will be able to access critical severity NFTs",
